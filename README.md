# Hive13 2014 Non-Functional Website Mockup

This is a non-functional mockup for the Hive13 2014 website redesign.

There may be more information later.

## Building

Run `brunch build` or `brunch watch` (or `brunch watch -s`) and it will magically appearify in `public/`.

This website mockup is a [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) project, started with the [Brunch with Steak skeleton](https://github.com/oddpixel/brunch-steak).  (AKA [Brunch with Steak and Eggs](https://github.com/oddpixel/brunch-steak-eggs))  It utilizes [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) / [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).
